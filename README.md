## Solitaire Written in Haskell

This repository implements a version of Klondike Solitare.  Most of the code is written in Haskell with a layer of typescript that works with the DOM.  The d3.js library is used to manipulate svg images (cards) and handle evenings mouse picks and movement.

You can [try the game out here](http://dc25.github.io/solitaire)
